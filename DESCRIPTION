Description: Finding the best values for user-specified arguments of a prediction algorithm can be difficult, particularly if there is an interaction between argument levels. This package automates the testing of any user-defined prediction algorithm over an arbitrary number of arguments. It includes functions for testing the algorithm over the given arguments with respect to an arbitrary number of user-defined diagnostics, visualising the results of these tests, and finding the optimal argument combinations with respect to each diagnostic.
